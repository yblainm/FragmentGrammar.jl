Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate EDOLAR EONE million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five UEDOTSEDOT senators who interceded with thriftEDASHindustry regulators for him EDOT 
MrEDOT Keating is currently the subject of a EDOLAR EONEEDOTEONE billion federal antiEDASHracketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled ECOMMA Lincoln Savings & Loan Association ECOMMA and driving it into insolvency EDOT

MrEDOT Wertheimer based this on a statement by MrEDOT Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April ECOLON EACUTEEACUTE One question EDOTEDOTEDOT had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause EDOT

In a highly unusual meeting in SenEDOT DeConcini ESINGLEQUOTEs office in April EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln EDOT 
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting ECOMMA the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ESINGLEQUOTE federally insured money and was EACUTEEACUTE a ticking time bomb EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
MrEDOT Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous EDOT 
The notes show that SenEDOT DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ESINGLEQUOTEs regulations EACUTEEACUTE grossly unfair ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE and that SenEDOT Glenn insisted that MrEDOT Keating ESINGLEQUOTEs thrift was EACUTEEACUTE viable and profitable EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
For the next two years ECOMMA the Bank Board ECOMMA which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts ECOMMA failed to act EDASHEDASH even after federal auditors warned in May EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN that MrEDOT Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent EDOT

SenEDOT DeConcini ECOMMA after months of fending off intense press criticism ECOMMA returned EDOLAR EFOUREEIGHTECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO only last month ECOMMA shortly after the government formally accused MrEDOT Keating of defrauding Lincoln EDOT

SenEDOT McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter EACUTEEACUTE fell between the cracks EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
MrEDOT Keating ECOMMA his family members and associates also donated EDOLAR EONEEONEETWOECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO to SenEDOT McCain ESINGLEQUOTEs congressional campaigns over the years ECOMMA according to press accounts EDOT 
But SenEDOT McCain says MrEDOT Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA because the senator refused to press the thrift executive ESINGLEQUOTEs case as vigorously as MrEDOT Keating wanted EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE He became very angry at that ECOMMA left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE SenEDOT McCain recalls EDOT 
In July ECOMMA California newspapers disclosed that MrEDOT Keating gave EDOLAR EEIGHTEFIVEEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate funds to three taxEDASHexempt voter registration organizations in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN and EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT at the behest of SenEDOT Cranston ECOMMA who conceded that soliciting the money was EACUTEEACUTE a pretty stupid thing to do politically EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
In addition ECOMMA SenEDOT Cranston received EDOLAR EFOURESEVENECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in campaign donations through MrEDOT Keating ECOMMA and the California Democratic party received EDOLAR EEIGHTEFIVEECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate donations for a EONEENINEEEIGHTESIX getEDASHoutEDASHtheEDASHvote drive that benefited the senator ESINGLEQUOTEs reEDASHelection campaign that year EDOT 
Also in July ECOMMA Ohio newspapers disclosed EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate donations by MrEDOT Keating to the National Council on Public Policy ECOMMA a political committee controlled by SenEDOT Glenn EDOT

SenEDOT McCain said he had been EACUTEEACUTE deeply concerned ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper ECOMMA but decided it was EACUTEEACUTE entirely appropriate ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent EDOT 
SenEDOT Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and EACUTEEACUTE I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE

The first major event this morning in UEDOTSEDOT stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange EDOT 
Under a reform arising from the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash ECOMMA trading in the Merc ESINGLEQUOTEs stockEDASHindex futures will break for EONEEZERO minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs close ECOMMA a move equal to EFOUREZERO points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average EDOT 
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange ECOMMA which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc EDOT 
That earlyEDASHmorning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash EDOT 
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume EDOT 
Several of those postEDASHcrash changes kicked in during Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs oneEDASHhour collapse and worked as expected ECOMMA even though they did nESINGLEQUOTEt prevent a stunning plunge EDOT 
But the major EACUTEEACUTE circuit breakers ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE have yet to be evaluated EDOT 
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test EDOT 
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other ECOMMA more sweeping changes proposed EDASHEDASH but not implemented EDASHEDASH after the last crash EDOT 
Most notably ECOMMA several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force ECOMMA which analyzed the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash ECOMMA would be revived EDASHEDASH especially because that group ESINGLEQUOTEs chairman is now the Treasury secretary EDOT 
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial crossEDASHmarket questions ECOMMA such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets EDOT 
But for the moment ECOMMA attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place ECOMMA and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended EDOT 
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc ESINGLEQUOTEs Standard & Poor ESINGLEQUOTEs EFIVEEZEROEZERO contract ECOMMA as well as EACUTEEACUTE hotEDASHline ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE communications among exchanges EDOT 
Those pauses EDASHEDASH from ETWOECOLONEZEROESEVEN pEDOTmEDOT to ETWOECOLONETHREEEZERO pEDOTmEDOT CDT and from ETWOECOLONEFOUREFIVE pEDOTmEDOT until the close of trading a halfEDASHhour later EDASHEDASH forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels EDOT 
During the first halt ECOMMA after the S&P index had fallen EONEETWO points ECOMMA the Big Board ESINGLEQUOTEs EACUTEEACUTE Sidecar ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE computer program automatically was triggered EDOT 
That system is designed to separate computerEDASHgenerated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks EDOT 
One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a wellEDASHdrilled school EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE You do nESINGLEQUOTEt want the fire but you know what to do ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said Howard Dubnow ECOMMA an independent floor broker and a Merc governor EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE There was no panic EDOT 
The system worked the way we devised it to work EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
After reopening for about EONEEFIVE minutes ECOMMA the S&P index tumbled to its ETHREEEZEROEDASHpoint limit and the second freeze went into effect EDOT 
Traders then spent the last halfEDASHhour EACUTEEACUTE watching to see if the Dow would drop ETWOEFIVEEZERO points ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE MrEDOT Dubnow added ECOMMA referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour EDOT 
One observer estimated that EEIGHTEZERO EPERCENT to ENINEEZERO EPERCENT of the S&P traders EACUTEEACUTE were just standing around watching EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
But the ETWOEFIVEEZEROEDASHpoint circuit breaker never had to kick in ECOMMA and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade ESINGLEQUOTEs Major Market Index also were nESINGLEQUOTEt triggered EDOT 
The MMI and the S&P EFIVEEZEROEZERO are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies EDOT 
The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash EDOT 
The process of postEDASHcrash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments EDOT 
In October EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA just after the market drop ECOMMA Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated EDOT 
Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions EDOT 
In addition ECOMMA limits were placed on computerEDASHdriven trading ECOMMA and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets EDOT 
Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated EDOT 
At the outset the prime target was program trading ECOMMA which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill EDOT 
There were also calls to strip the stock markets of EACUTEEACUTE derivative ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE products ECOMMA such as stockEDASHindex futures and options ECOMMA which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin ECOMMA for example ECOMMA likened to EACUTEEACUTE barnacles attached to the basic market EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange ESINGLEQUOTEs system of having stock trades flow through specialists ECOMMA or market makers EDOT 
When the Brady Task Force ESINGLEQUOTEs powerful analysis of the crash was released in January EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT ECOMMA it immediately reshaped the reformers ESINGLEQUOTE agenda EDOT 
Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one ECOMMA and concluding that the crash had EACUTEEACUTE raised the possibility of a fullEDASHscale financial system breakdown ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE the presidential task force called for establishing a superEDASHregulator to oversee the markets ECOMMA to make margins consistent across markets ECOMMA to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers EDOT 
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented EDOT 
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm ESINGLEQUOTEs length and named a second panel EDASHEDASH the Working Group on the Financial Markets EDASHEDASH to review its analysis and those of other crash studies EDOT 
In May EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT ECOMMA the Working Group ECOMMA made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve ECOMMA the Treasury ECOMMA the Securities and Exchange Commission ECOMMA and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ECOMMA finally endorsed only circuit breakers EDOT 
After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets ECOMMA circuit breakers were set in place ECOMMA with the most notable suspending trading after ETWOEFIVEEZERO and EFOUREZEROEZERO point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average EDOT 
Privately ECOMMA some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists EDOT 
After all ECOMMA this freeEDASHmarket argument went ECOMMA the Dow only dropped more than ETWOEFIVEEZERO points once this century EDOT

Trading dried up Friday in the market for highEDASHyield junk bonds ECOMMA often used to finance takeovers EDOT

Over the weeked ECOMMA however ECOMMA two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies EDOT 
Vitro SEDOTAEDOT ECOMMA a major Mexican glass maker ECOMMA said yesterday that it agreed to buy Anchor Glass Container in a tender offer for EDOLAR ETWOEONEEDOTETWOEFIVE a share ECOMMA sweetened from the original EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEDASHaEDASHshare offer Vitro launched two months ago EDOT 
On Friday ECOMMA Anchor shares fell EONE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEFOUR to close at EONEEEIGHT EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO EDOT 
For the broader market ECOMMA the greatest significance of the VitroEDASHAnchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night EDASHEDASH after the market rout EDASHEDASH and involves a EDOLAR EONEEFIVEEFIVE million temporary EACUTEEACUTE bridge ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE loan from Donaldson ECOMMA Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a EDOLAR EONEETHREEENINE million loan from Security Pacific National Bank EDOT 
Moreover ECOMMA to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt ECOMMA Donaldson said it is EACUTEEACUTE highly confident ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE that it will be able to sell EDOLAR EFOUREZEROEZERO million of junk bonds for Vitro ECOMMA despite the current disarray in the junk bond market EDOT 
Donaldson ESINGLEQUOTEs statement is nESINGLEQUOTEt merely an idle boast ECOMMA because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson ESINGLEQUOTEs bridge loan can be paid back EDOT 
Security Pacific ECOMMA meanwhile ECOMMA said it expects to arrange EDOLAR EFOURETHREEEZERO million in bank loans for Vitro EDOT 
In another takeover battle ECOMMA a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain EACUTEEACUTE highly confident ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE they can arrange EDOLAR EFOUREDOTEFIVE billion of bank loans for McCaw ESINGLEQUOTEs tender offer for about EFOUREFIVE EPERCENT of LIN Broadcasting ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE notwithstanding recent events EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE

On Friday ECOMMA LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that did nESINGLEQUOTEt fall much ECOMMA dropping EFIVE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO ECOMMA or EFOUREDOTENINE EPERCENT ECOMMA to close at EONEEZEROESEVEN EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO EDOT 
Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were nESINGLEQUOTEt hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a wellEDASHfinanced corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers EDOT 
Investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stockEDASHmarket drop EDOT 
Potential bidders for companies EACUTEEACUTE were saying that things were beginning to look expensive ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says MrEDOT Rattner of Lazard EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE Nothing makes things look cheaper than a ETWOEZEROEZEROEDASHpoint drop in the Dow ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE MrEDOT Rattner says EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE Just as there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock market ECOMMA there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be wellEDASHheeled corporations EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE In the past ECOMMA corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms ECOMMA which were often prepared to outbid ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE the corporations ECOMMA says JEDOT Tomilson Hill ECOMMA head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton EDOT 
Now ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE corporate buyers should be willing to reEDASHenter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbondEDASHfinanced buyers has been reduced EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Many takeover stocks plunged Friday ECOMMA as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks ECOMMA the targets of rumored deals EDOT 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment ECOMMA which has agreed to a friendly EDOLAR ETWOESEVENEDASHaEDASHshare bid from Sony of Japan ECOMMA fell only EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEEIGHT to close at ETWOESIX EFIVEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEEIGHT EDOT

The market EDASHEDASH and investment bankers EDASHEDASH are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid ECOMMA merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already EDOT 
Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market ECOMMA traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again EDOT 
Examples include Kollmorgen ECOMMA whose agreement to be acquired for EDOLAR ETWOEFIVE a share by Vernitron collapsed last month EDOT 
Kollmorgen shares fell nearly ETWOEZERO EPERCENT on Friday to close at EONEETWO ESEVENEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEEIGHT EDOT 
Ramada ECOMMA which first delayed and then shelved a EDOLAR EFOUREZEROEZERO million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring ECOMMA fell EONEEFIVEEDOTESIX EPERCENT to close at ENINE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO EDOT 
Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has nESINGLEQUOTEt indicated when it will do so EDOT 
Shares of American Medical International ECOMMA which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buyEDASHout group that includes First Boston CorpEDOT and the Pritzker family of Chicago ECOMMA fell EONEEFIVEEDOTEEIGHT EPERCENT on Friday to close at ETWOEZERO EDOT 
The buyEDASHout group is offering EDOLAR ETWOESIXEDOTEFIVEEZERO a share for ESIXETHREE million American Medical shares ECOMMA down from its offer in July of EDOLAR ETWOEEIGHT a share for ESIXEEIGHTEDOTEEIGHT million shares EDOT 
But investment bankers say the market may have oversold some takeoverEDASHrelated stocks EDOT 
Hilton Hotels ECOMMA for example ECOMMA was among the worstEDASHhit issues ECOMMA falling ETWOEZEROEDOTETWO EPERCENT to close at EEIGHTEFIVE ECOMMA down ETWOEONE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO on Friday EDOT 
Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses EDOT 
People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sellEDASHoff in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junkEDASHbond financing EDOT 
However ECOMMA they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buyEDASHout group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debtEDASHfinanced takeovers EDOT 
Hilton officials said they were nESINGLEQUOTEt worried about the drop in the company ESINGLEQUOTEs stock EDOT 
William Lebo ECOMMA Hilton ESINGLEQUOTEs general counsel ECOMMA said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are EACUTEEACUTE on track ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE for what has been described previously as EACUTEEACUTE a slow and deliberate process EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
EACUTEEACUTE I ca nESINGLEQUOTEt believe that any potential buyer for Hilton would be affected by one day ESINGLEQUOTEs trading ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE MrEDOT Lebo said EDOT 
But the stock market as a whole ECOMMA bolstered as it is by takeover speculation ECOMMA remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers ECOMMA both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks EDOT

The debate over National Service has begun again EDOT

President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service EDASHLRBEDASH YES EDASHRRBEDASH plan ECOMMA though its details remain to be specified EDOT 
What is one to think of all this ? 
Doctrine and special interests govern some responses EDOT 
People eager to have youth EACUTEEACUTE pay their dues to society ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE favor service proposals EDASHEDASH preferably mandatory ones EDOT 
So do those who seek a EACUTEEACUTE reEDASHenergized concept of citizenship ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights EDOT 
Then there are instinctive opponents EDOT 
To libertarians ECOMMA mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money EDOT 
Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform ECOLON 
If the market wo nESINGLEQUOTEt pay for it ECOMMA they argue ECOMMA it ca nESINGLEQUOTEt be worth its cost EDOT 
Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ESEMICOLON they see service as a cover for the draft ECOMMA or fear the regimentation of youth ECOMMA or want to see rights enlarged ECOMMA not obligations EDOT 
But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ? 
How should we think about national service ? 
Let ESINGLEQUOTEs begin by recognizing a main source of confusion EDASHEDASH EACUTEEACUTE national service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE has no agreed meaning EDOT 
Would service be voluntary or compulsory ? 
Short or long ? 
PartEDASHtime or fullEDASHtime ? 
Paid or unpaid ? 
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ? 
What kinds of work would they do ? 
What does EACUTEEACUTE national ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE mean ? 
Would the program be run by the federal government ECOMMA by local governments ECOMMA or by private voluntary organizations ? 
And who would serve ? 
Only males ECOMMA as with the draft ECOMMA or both sexes ? 
Youth only or all ages ? 
MiddleEDASHclass people ECOMMA or poor people ECOMMA or a genuine crossEDASHsection ? 
Many or few ? 
Those are not trivial questions ECOMMA and the label EACUTEEACUTE national service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE answers none of them EDOT 
Then how should we think about national service ? 
As a starting point ECOMMA here are five propositions ECOLON EONE EDOT Consider the ingredients ECOMMA not the name EDOT 
Ignore EACUTEEACUTE national service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE in the abstract ESEMICOLON consider specific proposals EDOT 
They will differ in crucial ways EDOT 
ETWO EDOT EACUTEEACUTE Service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE should be service EDOT 
As commonly understood ECOMMA service implies sacrifice EDOT 
It involves accepting risk ECOMMA or giving up income ECOMMA or deferring a career EDOT 
It follows that proposals like NunnEDASHMcCurdy ECOMMA whose benefits to enrollees are worth some EDOLAR EONEESEVENECOMMAEFIVEEZEROEZERO a year ECOMMA do not qualify EDOT 
There is a rationale for such bills ECOLON Federal subsidies to college students amount to EACUTEEACUTE a GI Bill without the GI ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE ESEMICOLON arguably those benefits should be earned ECOMMA not given EDOT 
But the earnings exceed by ETWOEZERO EPERCENT the average income of young highEDASHschool graduates with fullEDASHtime jobs EDOT 
Why call that service ? 
ETHREE EDOT Encouragement is fine ESEMICOLON compulsion is not EDOT 
Compelled service is unconstitutional EDOT 
It is also unwise and unenforceable EDOT 
EDASHLRBEDASH Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? EDASHRRBEDASH 
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior EDOT 
It should also encourage service EDASHEDASH preferably by all classes and all ages EDOT 
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the UEDOTSEDOT ECOMMA should build on the service programs already in existence ECOMMA and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing EDOT 
EFOUR EDOT Good programs are not cheap EDOT 
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply ECOLON forest fires fought ECOMMA housing rehabilitated ECOMMA students tutored ECOMMA dayEDASHcare centers staffed EDOT 
There is important work to be done ECOMMA and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well EDASHEDASH but not cheaply EDOT 
Good service programs require recruitment ECOMMA screening ECOMMA training and supervision EDASHEDASH all of high quality EDOT 
They involve stipends to participants EDOT 
FullEDASHtime residential programs also require housing and fullEDASHtime supervision ESEMICOLON they are particularly expensive EDASHEDASH more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale EDOT 
NonEDASHresidential programs are cheaper ECOMMA but good ones still come to some EDOLAR EONEEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO a year EDOT 
Are they worth that ? 
Evaluations suggest that good ones are EDASHEDASH especially so if the effects on participants are counted EDOT 
But the calculations are challengeable EDOT 
EFIVE EDOT Underclass youth are a special concern EDOT 
Are such expenditures worthwhile ECOMMA then ? 
Yes ECOMMA if targeted EDOT 
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve ECOMMA but there are many ways for middleEDASHclass kids ECOMMA and their elders ECOMMA to serve at little public cost EDOT 
They can volunteer at any of thousands of nonEDASHprofit institutions ECOMMA or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers EDOT 
Underclass youth do nESINGLEQUOTEt have those opportunities EDOT 
They are not enrolled in high school or college EDOT 
They are unlikely to be employed EDOT 
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances ECOMMA among family structures breaking down ECOMMA surrounded by selfEDASHdestructive behaviors and bleak prospects EDOT 
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service EDOT 
Some wo nESINGLEQUOTEt accept the discipline ESEMICOLON others drop out for other reasons EDOT 
But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed EDOT 
Learning skills ECOMMA producing something cooperatively ECOMMA feeling useful ECOMMA they are no longer dependent EDASHEDASH others now depend on them EDOT 
Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant duneEDASHgrass with paid professionals ECOMMA the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation EDOT 
Strictly speaking ECOMMA these youth are not performing service EDOT 
They are giving up no income ECOMMA deferring no careers ECOMMA incurring no risk EDOT 
But they believe themselves to be serving ECOMMA and they begin to respect themselves EDASHLRBEDASH and others EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA to take control of their lives ECOMMA to think of the future EDOT 
That is a service to the nation EDOT 
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve EDOT

EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer ECOMMA Thames Television EDOT 
The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN EDOT 
Let ESINGLEQUOTEs make that EONEENINEETWOENINE ECOMMA just to be sure EDOT 
According to the program ESINGLEQUOTEs publicity prospectus ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE set at Shane Longman ECOMMA a fictional midEDASHsized securities firm with EHASH EFIVEEZEROEZERO million capital ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE follows the fortunes of a closeEDASHknit team of young ECOMMA highEDASHflying dealers ECOMMA hired for their particular blend of style ECOMMA genius and energy EDOT 
But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ESEMICOLON pressure to pull off another million before lunch ESEMICOLON pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second EDOTEDOTEDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
You need nESINGLEQUOTEt be a highEDASHpowered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure EDOT 
The slickly produced series has been criticized by London ESINGLEQUOTEs financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail ECOMMA but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ESINGLEQUOTE professional and private lives EDOT 
Turned loose in Shane Longman ESINGLEQUOTEs trading room ECOMMA the yuppie dealers do little right EDOT 
Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes ECOMMA Shane Longman ESINGLEQUOTEs capital should be just about exhausted by the final EONEETHREEth week EDOT 
In the opening episode we learn that Michelle ECOMMA a junior bond trader ECOMMA has indeed pulled off another million before lunch EDOT 
Trouble is ECOMMA she has lost it just as quickly EDOT 
Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world ECOMMA Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone EDOT 
Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today EDOT 
Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds ECOMMA in the belief that the UEDOTSEDOT monthly trade figures will look lousy EDOT 
Ah ECOMMA perfidious Columbia ! 
The trade figures turn out well ECOMMA and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price EDOT 
So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second EDOT 
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds EDASHLRBEDASH since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays ? EDASHRRBEDASH EDOT 
Surprisingly ECOMMA Shane Longman survives the week ECOMMA only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation EDOT 
Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm ESINGLEQUOTEs reputation ECOMMA the executive ESINGLEQUOTEs internal rivals ECOMMA led by a loutish American ECOMMA demand his resignation EDOT 
The plot is thwarted when the firm ESINGLEQUOTEs major stockholder ECOMMA kelp farming on the other side of the globe ECOMMA hurries home to support the executive EDOT 
But the investigation continues EDOT 
If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are sixEDASHfigure salaries ECOMMA you still are left puzzled ECOMMA because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously EDOT 
In fact ECOMMA few consume much of anything EDOT 
Two share a house almost devoid of furniture EDOT 
Michelle lives in a hotel room ECOMMA and although she drives a canaryEDASHcolored Porsche ECOMMA she has nESINGLEQUOTEt time to clean or repair it ESEMICOLON the beatEDASHup vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock EDOT 
And it takes Declan ECOMMA the obligatory ladies ESINGLEQUOTE man of the cast ECOMMA until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey EDOT 
Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that classEDASHconscious Britain is nESINGLEQUOTEt ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian freeEDASHenterprise regime EDOT 
After all ECOMMA this is nESINGLEQUOTEt old money ECOMMA but new money ECOMMA and in many cases ECOMMA young money EDOT 
This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max ECOMMA the trading room ESINGLEQUOTEs most flamboyant character EDOT 
Yuppily enough ECOMMA he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church ECOMMA wears designer clothes and drives an antique car EDOT 
But apparently to make him palatable ECOMMA even lovable ECOMMA to the masses ECOMMA the script inflates ponyEDASHtailed Max into an eccentric genius ECOMMA master of EONEEONE Chinese dialects EDOT 
He takes his wash to the laundromat ECOMMA where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe EDOT 
In producing and promoting EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day EDOT 
The production costs are a not inconsiderable EHASH EEIGHT million EDASHLRBEDASH EDOLAR EONEETWOEDOTEFOUR million EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of EACUTEEACUTE Dealers ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE an earlier madeEDASHforEDASHTV movie EDOT 
Another half million quid went for a volley of fullEDASHpage advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway EDOT 
These expenses create a special incentive for EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ESINGLEQUOTEs ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE producers to flog it ECOMMA or a YankEDASHoriented version of it ECOMMA in America EDOT 
Thames ESINGLEQUOTEs UEDOTSEDOT marketing agent ECOMMA Donald Taffner ECOMMA is preparing to do just that EDOT

The seeds already are in the script EDOT 
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the tradingEDASHroom crew minded a baby ECOMMA the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm EDOT

They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air EDOT 
Even network executives ECOMMA however ECOMMA admit privately that victory EDASHEDASH either in Congress or in talks with the studios EDASHEDASH is highly doubtful any time soon EDOT 
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the EACUTEEACUTE finEDASHsyn ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE provisions ECOMMA known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules EDOT 
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting CoEDOT ECOMMA backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric CoEDOT ECOMMA had tried to help fund Qintex Australia LtdEDOT ESINGLEQUOTEs nowEDASHscuttled EDOLAR EONEEDOTEFIVE billion bid for MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA Communications Co EDOT 
NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs interest may revive the deal ECOMMA which MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash EDOT 
Even if that deal is nESINGLEQUOTEt revived ECOMMA NBC hopes to find another EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE Our doors are open ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE an NBC spokesman says EDOT 
NBC may yet find a way to take a passive ECOMMA minority interest in a programEDASHmaker without violating the rules EDOT 
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS IncEDOT and ABC ESINGLEQUOTEs parent ECOMMA Capital CitiesEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHABC IncEDOT ECOMMA to look for ways of skirting the finEDASHsyn regulations EDOT 
But the networks ESINGLEQUOTE push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios EDOT 
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing finEDASHsyn restraints EDOT 
Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge EDOT 
The networks still are EACUTEEACUTE uninhibited in their authority ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE over what shows get on the air ECOMMA charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti ECOMMA the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules EDOT 
Studios are EACUTEEACUTE powerless ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE to get shows in primeEDASHtime lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales ECOMMA he contends EDOT 
And that ESINGLEQUOTEs why the rules ECOMMA for the most part ECOMMA must stay in place ECOMMA he says EDOT 
Studio executives in on the talks EDASH including officials at Paramount Communications IncEDOT ECOMMA Fries Entertainment IncEDOT ECOMMA Warner Communications IncEDOT and MCA IncEDOT EDASHEDASH declined to be interviewed EDOT 
But MrEDOT Valenti ECOMMA who represents the studios ECOMMA asserts ECOLON EACUTEEACUTE The whole production industry ECOMMA to a man ECOMMA is on the side of preserving ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE the rules EDOT 
Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE They do nESINGLEQUOTEt seem to have an incentive to negotiate ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says one network executive EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE And there ESINGLEQUOTEs no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules EDOT 
That ESINGLEQUOTEs the problem ECOMMA is nESINGLEQUOTEt it ? ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Indeed it is EDOT 
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess ECOMMA urging the studios and the networks ECOMMA which license rights to air shows made by the studios ECOMMA to work out their own compromise EDOT 
But recent developments have made the networks EDASHEDASH and NBC President Robert Wright ECOMMA in particular EDASHEDASH ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive EDOT 
The latest provocation ECOLON Sony CorpEDOT ESINGLEQUOTEs plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment IncEDOT for EDOLAR ETHREEEDOTEFOUR billion ECOMMA and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment CoEDOT for EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEZERO million EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the SonyEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHColumbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE wrote JEDOTBEDOT Holston ECOMMA an NBC vice president ECOMMA in a commentary in last week ESINGLEQUOTEs issue of Broadcasting magazine EDOT 
In his article ECOMMA MrEDOT Holston ECOMMA who was in Europe last week and unavailable ECOMMA complained that the EACUTEEACUTE archaic restraints ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE in finEDASHsyn rules have EACUTEEACUTE contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by nonEDASHUEDOTSEDOT enterprises EDOT 
ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE EDASHLRBEDASH He did nESINGLEQUOTEt mention that NBC ECOMMA in the meantime ECOMMA was hoping to assist Australia ESINGLEQUOTEs Qintex in buying 
An NBC spokesman counters that MrEDOT Holston ESINGLEQUOTEs lament was EACUTEEACUTE entirely consistent ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE with NBC plans because the UEDOTSEDOT rules would limit NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be EACUTEEACUTE light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony EDASHEDASH and everyone else except the three networks EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
The Big Three ESINGLEQUOTEs drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time IncEDOT went ahead with plans to acquire Warner EDOT 
Although Time already had a longEDASHterm contract to buy movies from Warner ECOMMA the merger will let Time ESINGLEQUOTEs largely unregulated payEDASHcable channel ECOMMA Home Box Office ECOMMA own the Warner movies aired on HBO EDASHEDASH a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by finEDASHsyn regulations EDOT 
NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs MrEDOT Wright led the way in decrying the networks ESINGLEQUOTE inability to match a TimeEDASHWarner combination EDOT 
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced EDOT 
Since NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs interest in the Qintex bid for MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA was disclosed ECOMMA MrEDOT Wright has nESINGLEQUOTEt been available for comment EDOT 
With a Qintex deal ECOMMA NBC would move into uncharted territory EDASHEDASH possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE It ESINGLEQUOTEs never really been tested ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says William Lilley III ECOMMA who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted EDOT 
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington ECOMMA consulting to media companies EDOT 
FinEDASHsyn rules do nESINGLEQUOTEt explicitly block a network from buying a passive ECOMMA small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca nESINGLEQUOTEt enjoy EDOT 
Hence ECOMMA NBC might be able to take ECOMMA say ECOMMA a EFIVE EPERCENT stake in a company such as MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA EDOT 
If the transaction raised objections ECOMMA the studio ESINGLEQUOTEs syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does nESINGLEQUOTEt have a direct stake EDOT 
But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication EDOT 
Under current rules ECOMMA even when a network fares well with a EONEEZEROEZEROEPERCENTEDASHowned series EDASHEDASH ABC ECOMMA for example ECOMMA made a killing in broadcasting its popular crimeEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHcomedy EACUTEEACUTE Moonlighting ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE EDASHEDASH it is nESINGLEQUOTEt allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations EDOT 
Instead ECOMMA ABC will have to sell off the rights for a oneEDASHtime fee EDOT 
The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim EDASHEDASH for several years at the least EDOT 
Six years ago they were tantalizingly close EDOT 
The ReaganEDASHera Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules EDOT 
Various evidence ECOMMA including a Brookings Institution study of some EEIGHTEZEROEZERO series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the EONEENINEESIXEZEROs ECOMMA showed the networks did nESINGLEQUOTEt wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged EDOT 
But just eight days before the rules were to die ECOMMA former President Ronald Reagan ECOMMA a oneEDASHtime actor ECOMMA intervened on behalf of Hollywood EDOT 
The FCC effort collapsed EDOT 
The networks and studios have bickered ever since EDOT 
Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington ECOMMA but that seems unlikely EDOT 
In Congress ECOMMA the issue falters ECOLON It ESINGLEQUOTEs about money ECOMMA not program quality ECOMMA and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue EDOT 
A spokesman for RepEDOT Edward JEDOT Markey EDASHLRBEDASH DEDASHMassEDOT EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC ECOMMA says MrEDOT Markey feels EACUTEEACUTE the world has been forever changed by the SonyEDASHColumbia deal EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
But he said MrEDOT Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own EDOT 
And at the FCC ECOMMA meanwhile ECOMMA new Chairman Alfred CEDOT Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan EDOT 
Roger Rosenblatt ECOMMA editor of UEDOTSEDOT News & World Report ECOMMA resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine EDOT 
MrEDOT Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine ESINGLEQUOTEs editorial offices in Washington EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE Frankly ECOMMA I missed my family ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said MrEDOT Rosenblatt EDOT 
In MrEDOT Rosenblatt ESINGLEQUOTEs tenure ECOMMA the magazine ESINGLEQUOTEs advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly EDOT

Mortimer BEDOT Zuckerman ECOMMA chairman and editor in chief ECOMMA said MrEDOT Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby ECOMMA the magazine ESINGLEQUOTEs executive editor ECOMMA and Merrill McLoughlin ECOMMA a senior writer EDOT 
MrEDOT Ruby and MsEDOT McLoughlin are married to each other EDOT 
MrEDOT Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format ECOMMA which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with serviceEDASHoriented ECOMMA howEDASHto articles EDOT 
MrEDOT Rosenblatt ECOMMA a senior writer at Time magazine before joining UEDOTSEDOT News & World Report ECOMMA said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor EDOT
