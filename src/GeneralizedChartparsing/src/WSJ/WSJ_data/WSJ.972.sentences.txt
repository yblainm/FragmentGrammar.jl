Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate EDOLAR EONE million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five UEDOTSEDOT senators who interceded with thriftEDASHindustry regulators for him EDOT 
MrEDOT Keating is currently the subject of a EDOLAR EONEEDOTEONE billion federal antiEDASHracketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled ECOMMA Lincoln Savings & Loan Association ECOMMA and driving it into insolvency EDOT

MrEDOT Wertheimer based this on a statement by MrEDOT Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April ECOLON EACUTEEACUTE One question EDOTEDOTEDOT had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause EDOT

In a highly unusual meeting in SenEDOT DeConcini ESINGLEQUOTEs office in April EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln EDOT 
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting ECOMMA the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ESINGLEQUOTE federally insured money and was EACUTEEACUTE a ticking time bomb EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
MrEDOT Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous EDOT 
The notes show that SenEDOT DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ESINGLEQUOTEs regulations EACUTEEACUTE grossly unfair ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE and that SenEDOT Glenn insisted that MrEDOT Keating ESINGLEQUOTEs thrift was EACUTEEACUTE viable and profitable EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
For the next two years ECOMMA the Bank Board ECOMMA which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts ECOMMA failed to act EDASHEDASH even after federal auditors warned in May EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN that MrEDOT Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent EDOT

SenEDOT DeConcini ECOMMA after months of fending off intense press criticism ECOMMA returned EDOLAR EFOUREEIGHTECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO only last month ECOMMA shortly after the government formally accused MrEDOT Keating of defrauding Lincoln EDOT

SenEDOT McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter EACUTEEACUTE fell between the cracks EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
MrEDOT Keating ECOMMA his family members and associates also donated EDOLAR EONEEONEETWOECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO to SenEDOT McCain ESINGLEQUOTEs congressional campaigns over the years ECOMMA according to press accounts EDOT 
But SenEDOT McCain says MrEDOT Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA because the senator refused to press the thrift executive ESINGLEQUOTEs case as vigorously as MrEDOT Keating wanted EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE He became very angry at that ECOMMA left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE SenEDOT McCain recalls EDOT 
In July ECOMMA California newspapers disclosed that MrEDOT Keating gave EDOLAR EEIGHTEFIVEEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate funds to three taxEDASHexempt voter registration organizations in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN and EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT at the behest of SenEDOT Cranston ECOMMA who conceded that soliciting the money was EACUTEEACUTE a pretty stupid thing to do politically EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
In addition ECOMMA SenEDOT Cranston received EDOLAR EFOURESEVENECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in campaign donations through MrEDOT Keating ECOMMA and the California Democratic party received EDOLAR EEIGHTEFIVEECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate donations for a EONEENINEEEIGHTESIX getEDASHoutEDASHtheEDASHvote drive that benefited the senator ESINGLEQUOTEs reEDASHelection campaign that year EDOT 
Also in July ECOMMA Ohio newspapers disclosed EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate donations by MrEDOT Keating to the National Council on Public Policy ECOMMA a political committee controlled by SenEDOT Glenn EDOT

SenEDOT McCain said he had been EACUTEEACUTE deeply concerned ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper ECOMMA but decided it was EACUTEEACUTE entirely appropriate ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent EDOT 
SenEDOT Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and EACUTEEACUTE I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE

The first major event this morning in UEDOTSEDOT stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange EDOT 
Under a reform arising from the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash ECOMMA trading in the Merc ESINGLEQUOTEs stockEDASHindex futures will break for EONEEZERO minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs close ECOMMA a move equal to EFOUREZERO points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average EDOT 
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange ECOMMA which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc EDOT 
That earlyEDASHmorning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash EDOT 
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume EDOT 
Several of those postEDASHcrash changes kicked in during Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs oneEDASHhour collapse and worked as expected ECOMMA even though they did nESINGLEQUOTEt prevent a stunning plunge EDOT 
But the major EACUTEEACUTE circuit breakers ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE have yet to be evaluated EDOT 
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test EDOT 
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other ECOMMA more sweeping changes proposed EDASHEDASH but not implemented EDASHEDASH after the last crash EDOT 
Most notably ECOMMA several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force ECOMMA which analyzed the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash ECOMMA would be revived EDASHEDASH especially because that group ESINGLEQUOTEs chairman is now the Treasury secretary EDOT 
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial crossEDASHmarket questions ECOMMA such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets EDOT 
But for the moment ECOMMA attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place ECOMMA and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended EDOT 
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc ESINGLEQUOTEs Standard & Poor ESINGLEQUOTEs EFIVEEZEROEZERO contract ECOMMA as well as EACUTEEACUTE hotEDASHline ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE communications among exchanges EDOT 
Those pauses EDASHEDASH from ETWOECOLONEZEROESEVEN pEDOTmEDOT to ETWOECOLONETHREEEZERO pEDOTmEDOT CDT and from ETWOECOLONEFOUREFIVE pEDOTmEDOT until the close of trading a halfEDASHhour later EDASHEDASH forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels EDOT 
During the first halt ECOMMA after the S&P index had fallen EONEETWO points ECOMMA the Big Board ESINGLEQUOTEs EACUTEEACUTE Sidecar ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE computer program automatically was triggered EDOT 
That system is designed to separate computerEDASHgenerated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks EDOT 
One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a wellEDASHdrilled school EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE You do nESINGLEQUOTEt want the fire but you know what to do ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said Howard Dubnow ECOMMA an independent floor broker and a Merc governor EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE There was no panic EDOT 
The system worked the way we devised it to work EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
After reopening for about EONEEFIVE minutes ECOMMA the S&P index tumbled to its ETHREEEZEROEDASHpoint limit and the second freeze went into effect EDOT 
Traders then spent the last halfEDASHhour EACUTEEACUTE watching to see if the Dow would drop ETWOEFIVEEZERO points ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE MrEDOT Dubnow added ECOMMA referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour EDOT 
One observer estimated that EEIGHTEZERO EPERCENT to ENINEEZERO EPERCENT of the S&P traders EACUTEEACUTE were just standing around watching EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
But the ETWOEFIVEEZEROEDASHpoint circuit breaker never had to kick in ECOMMA and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade ESINGLEQUOTEs Major Market Index also were nESINGLEQUOTEt triggered EDOT 
The MMI and the S&P EFIVEEZEROEZERO are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies EDOT 
The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash EDOT 
The process of postEDASHcrash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments EDOT 
In October EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA just after the market drop ECOMMA Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated EDOT 
Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions EDOT 
In addition ECOMMA limits were placed on computerEDASHdriven trading ECOMMA and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets EDOT 
Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated EDOT 
At the outset the prime target was program trading ECOMMA which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill EDOT 
There were also calls to strip the stock markets of EACUTEEACUTE derivative ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE products ECOMMA such as stockEDASHindex futures and options ECOMMA which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin ECOMMA for example ECOMMA likened to EACUTEEACUTE barnacles attached to the basic market EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange ESINGLEQUOTEs system of having stock trades flow through specialists ECOMMA or market makers EDOT 
When the Brady Task Force ESINGLEQUOTEs powerful analysis of the crash was released in January EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT ECOMMA it immediately reshaped the reformers ESINGLEQUOTE agenda EDOT 
Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one ECOMMA and concluding that the crash had EACUTEEACUTE raised the possibility of a fullEDASHscale financial system breakdown ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE the presidential task force called for establishing a superEDASHregulator to oversee the markets ECOMMA to make margins consistent across markets ECOMMA to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers EDOT 
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented EDOT 
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm ESINGLEQUOTEs length and named a second panel EDASHEDASH the Working Group on the Financial Markets EDASHEDASH to review its analysis and those of other crash studies EDOT 
In May EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT ECOMMA the Working Group ECOMMA made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve ECOMMA the Treasury ECOMMA the Securities and Exchange Commission ECOMMA and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ECOMMA finally endorsed only circuit breakers EDOT 
After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets ECOMMA circuit breakers were set in place ECOMMA with the most notable suspending trading after ETWOEFIVEEZERO and EFOUREZEROEZERO point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average EDOT 
Privately ECOMMA some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists EDOT 
After all ECOMMA this freeEDASHmarket argument went ECOMMA the Dow only dropped more than ETWOEFIVEEZERO points once this century EDOT

Trading dried up Friday in the market for highEDASHyield junk bonds ECOMMA often used to finance takeovers EDOT

Over the weeked ECOMMA however ECOMMA two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies EDOT 
Vitro SEDOTAEDOT ECOMMA a major Mexican glass maker ECOMMA said yesterday that it agreed to buy Anchor Glass Container in a tender offer for EDOLAR ETWOEONEEDOTETWOEFIVE a share ECOMMA sweetened from the original EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEDASHaEDASHshare offer Vitro launched two months ago EDOT 
On Friday ECOMMA Anchor shares fell EONE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEFOUR to close at EONEEEIGHT EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO EDOT 
For the broader market ECOMMA the greatest significance of the VitroEDASHAnchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night EDASHEDASH after the market rout EDASHEDASH and involves a EDOLAR EONEEFIVEEFIVE million temporary EACUTEEACUTE bridge ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE loan from Donaldson ECOMMA Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a EDOLAR EONEETHREEENINE million loan from Security Pacific National Bank EDOT 
Moreover ECOMMA to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt ECOMMA Donaldson said it is EACUTEEACUTE highly confident ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE that it will be able to sell EDOLAR EFOUREZEROEZERO million of junk bonds for Vitro ECOMMA despite the current disarray in the junk bond market EDOT 
Donaldson ESINGLEQUOTEs statement is nESINGLEQUOTEt merely an idle boast ECOMMA because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson ESINGLEQUOTEs bridge loan can be paid back EDOT 
Security Pacific ECOMMA meanwhile ECOMMA said it expects to arrange EDOLAR EFOURETHREEEZERO million in bank loans for Vitro EDOT 
In another takeover battle ECOMMA a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain EACUTEEACUTE highly confident ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE they can arrange EDOLAR EFOUREDOTEFIVE billion of bank loans for McCaw ESINGLEQUOTEs tender offer for about EFOUREFIVE EPERCENT of LIN Broadcasting ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE notwithstanding recent events EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE

On Friday ECOMMA LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that did nESINGLEQUOTEt fall much ECOMMA dropping EFIVE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO ECOMMA or EFOUREDOTENINE EPERCENT ECOMMA to close at EONEEZEROESEVEN EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO EDOT 
Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were nESINGLEQUOTEt hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a wellEDASHfinanced corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers EDOT 
Investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stockEDASHmarket drop EDOT 
Potential bidders for companies EACUTEEACUTE were saying that things were beginning to look expensive ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says MrEDOT Rattner of Lazard EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE Nothing makes things look cheaper than a ETWOEZEROEZEROEDASHpoint drop in the Dow ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE MrEDOT Rattner says EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE Just as there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock market ECOMMA there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be wellEDASHheeled corporations EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE In the past ECOMMA corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms ECOMMA which were often prepared to outbid ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE the corporations ECOMMA says JEDOT Tomilson Hill ECOMMA head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton EDOT 
Now ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE corporate buyers should be willing to reEDASHenter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbondEDASHfinanced buyers has been reduced EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Many takeover stocks plunged Friday ECOMMA as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks ECOMMA the targets of rumored deals EDOT 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment ECOMMA which has agreed to a friendly EDOLAR ETWOESEVENEDASHaEDASHshare bid from Sony of Japan ECOMMA fell only EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEEIGHT to close at ETWOESIX EFIVEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEEIGHT EDOT

The market EDASHEDASH and investment bankers EDASHEDASH are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid ECOMMA merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already EDOT 
Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market ECOMMA traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again EDOT 
Examples include Kollmorgen ECOMMA whose agreement to be acquired for EDOLAR ETWOEFIVE a share by Vernitron collapsed last month EDOT 
Kollmorgen shares fell nearly ETWOEZERO EPERCENT on Friday to close at EONEETWO ESEVENEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHEEIGHT EDOT 
Ramada ECOMMA which first delayed and then shelved a EDOLAR EFOUREZEROEZERO million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring ECOMMA fell EONEEFIVEEDOTESIX EPERCENT to close at ENINE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO EDOT 
Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has nESINGLEQUOTEt indicated when it will do so EDOT 
Shares of American Medical International ECOMMA which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buyEDASHout group that includes First Boston CorpEDOT and the Pritzker family of Chicago ECOMMA fell EONEEFIVEEDOTEEIGHT EPERCENT on Friday to close at ETWOEZERO EDOT 
The buyEDASHout group is offering EDOLAR ETWOESIXEDOTEFIVEEZERO a share for ESIXETHREE million American Medical shares ECOMMA down from its offer in July of EDOLAR ETWOEEIGHT a share for ESIXEEIGHTEDOTEEIGHT million shares EDOT 
But investment bankers say the market may have oversold some takeoverEDASHrelated stocks EDOT 
Hilton Hotels ECOMMA for example ECOMMA was among the worstEDASHhit issues ECOMMA falling ETWOEZEROEDOTETWO EPERCENT to close at EEIGHTEFIVE ECOMMA down ETWOEONE EONEEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHETWO on Friday EDOT 
Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses EDOT 
People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sellEDASHoff in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junkEDASHbond financing EDOT 
However ECOMMA they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buyEDASHout group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debtEDASHfinanced takeovers EDOT 
Hilton officials said they were nESINGLEQUOTEt worried about the drop in the company ESINGLEQUOTEs stock EDOT 
William Lebo ECOMMA Hilton ESINGLEQUOTEs general counsel ECOMMA said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are EACUTEEACUTE on track ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE for what has been described previously as EACUTEEACUTE a slow and deliberate process EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
EACUTEEACUTE I ca nESINGLEQUOTEt believe that any potential buyer for Hilton would be affected by one day ESINGLEQUOTEs trading ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE MrEDOT Lebo said EDOT 
But the stock market as a whole ECOMMA bolstered as it is by takeover speculation ECOMMA remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers ECOMMA both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks EDOT

The debate over National Service has begun again EDOT

President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service EDASHLRBEDASH YES EDASHRRBEDASH plan ECOMMA though its details remain to be specified EDOT 
What is one to think of all this ? 
Doctrine and special interests govern some responses EDOT 
People eager to have youth EACUTEEACUTE pay their dues to society ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE favor service proposals EDASHEDASH preferably mandatory ones EDOT 
So do those who seek a EACUTEEACUTE reEDASHenergized concept of citizenship ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights EDOT 
Then there are instinctive opponents EDOT 
To libertarians ECOMMA mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money EDOT 
Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform ECOLON 
If the market wo nESINGLEQUOTEt pay for it ECOMMA they argue ECOMMA it ca nESINGLEQUOTEt be worth its cost EDOT 
Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ESEMICOLON they see service as a cover for the draft ECOMMA or fear the regimentation of youth ECOMMA or want to see rights enlarged ECOMMA not obligations EDOT 
But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ? 
How should we think about national service ? 
Let ESINGLEQUOTEs begin by recognizing a main source of confusion EDASHEDASH EACUTEEACUTE national service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE has no agreed meaning EDOT 
Would service be voluntary or compulsory ? 
Short or long ? 
PartEDASHtime or fullEDASHtime ? 
Paid or unpaid ? 
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ? 
What kinds of work would they do ? 
What does EACUTEEACUTE national ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE mean ? 
Would the program be run by the federal government ECOMMA by local governments ECOMMA or by private voluntary organizations ? 
And who would serve ? 
Only males ECOMMA as with the draft ECOMMA or both sexes ? 
Youth only or all ages ? 
MiddleEDASHclass people ECOMMA or poor people ECOMMA or a genuine crossEDASHsection ? 
Many or few ? 
Those are not trivial questions ECOMMA and the label EACUTEEACUTE national service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE answers none of them EDOT 
Then how should we think about national service ? 
As a starting point ECOMMA here are five propositions ECOLON EONE EDOT Consider the ingredients ECOMMA not the name EDOT 
Ignore EACUTEEACUTE national service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE in the abstract ESEMICOLON consider specific proposals EDOT 
They will differ in crucial ways EDOT 
ETWO EDOT EACUTEEACUTE Service ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE should be service EDOT 
As commonly understood ECOMMA service implies sacrifice EDOT 
It involves accepting risk ECOMMA or giving up income ECOMMA or deferring a career EDOT 
It follows that proposals like NunnEDASHMcCurdy ECOMMA whose benefits to enrollees are worth some EDOLAR EONEESEVENECOMMAEFIVEEZEROEZERO a year ECOMMA do not qualify EDOT 
There is a rationale for such bills ECOLON Federal subsidies to college students amount to EACUTEEACUTE a GI Bill without the GI ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE ESEMICOLON arguably those benefits should be earned ECOMMA not given EDOT 
But the earnings exceed by ETWOEZERO EPERCENT the average income of young highEDASHschool graduates with fullEDASHtime jobs EDOT 
Why call that service ? 
ETHREE EDOT Encouragement is fine ESEMICOLON compulsion is not EDOT 
Compelled service is unconstitutional EDOT 
It is also unwise and unenforceable EDOT 
EDASHLRBEDASH Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? EDASHRRBEDASH 
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior EDOT 
It should also encourage service EDASHEDASH preferably by all classes and all ages EDOT 
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the UEDOTSEDOT ECOMMA should build on the service programs already in existence ECOMMA and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing EDOT 
EFOUR EDOT Good programs are not cheap EDOT 
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply ECOLON forest fires fought ECOMMA housing rehabilitated ECOMMA students tutored ECOMMA dayEDASHcare centers staffed EDOT 
There is important work to be done ECOMMA and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well EDASHEDASH but not cheaply EDOT 
Good service programs require recruitment ECOMMA screening ECOMMA training and supervision EDASHEDASH all of high quality EDOT 
They involve stipends to participants EDOT 
FullEDASHtime residential programs also require housing and fullEDASHtime supervision ESEMICOLON they are particularly expensive EDASHEDASH more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale EDOT 
NonEDASHresidential programs are cheaper ECOMMA but good ones still come to some EDOLAR EONEEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO a year EDOT 
Are they worth that ? 
Evaluations suggest that good ones are EDASHEDASH especially so if the effects on participants are counted EDOT 
But the calculations are challengeable EDOT 
EFIVE EDOT Underclass youth are a special concern EDOT 
Are such expenditures worthwhile ECOMMA then ? 
Yes ECOMMA if targeted EDOT 
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve ECOMMA but there are many ways for middleEDASHclass kids ECOMMA and their elders ECOMMA to serve at little public cost EDOT 
They can volunteer at any of thousands of nonEDASHprofit institutions ECOMMA or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers EDOT 
Underclass youth do nESINGLEQUOTEt have those opportunities EDOT 
They are not enrolled in high school or college EDOT 
They are unlikely to be employed EDOT 
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances ECOMMA among family structures breaking down ECOMMA surrounded by selfEDASHdestructive behaviors and bleak prospects EDOT 
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service EDOT 
Some wo nESINGLEQUOTEt accept the discipline ESEMICOLON others drop out for other reasons EDOT 
But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed EDOT 
Learning skills ECOMMA producing something cooperatively ECOMMA feeling useful ECOMMA they are no longer dependent EDASHEDASH others now depend on them EDOT 
Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant duneEDASHgrass with paid professionals ECOMMA the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation EDOT 
Strictly speaking ECOMMA these youth are not performing service EDOT 
They are giving up no income ECOMMA deferring no careers ECOMMA incurring no risk EDOT 
But they believe themselves to be serving ECOMMA and they begin to respect themselves EDASHLRBEDASH and others EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA to take control of their lives ECOMMA to think of the future EDOT 
That is a service to the nation EDOT 
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve EDOT

EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer ECOMMA Thames Television EDOT 
The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN EDOT 
Let ESINGLEQUOTEs make that EONEENINEETWOENINE ECOMMA just to be sure EDOT 
According to the program ESINGLEQUOTEs publicity prospectus ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE set at Shane Longman ECOMMA a fictional midEDASHsized securities firm with EHASH EFIVEEZEROEZERO million capital ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE follows the fortunes of a closeEDASHknit team of young ECOMMA highEDASHflying dealers ECOMMA hired for their particular blend of style ECOMMA genius and energy EDOT 
But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ESEMICOLON pressure to pull off another million before lunch ESEMICOLON pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second EDOTEDOTEDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
You need nESINGLEQUOTEt be a highEDASHpowered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure EDOT 
The slickly produced series has been criticized by London ESINGLEQUOTEs financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail ECOMMA but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ESINGLEQUOTE professional and private lives EDOT 
Turned loose in Shane Longman ESINGLEQUOTEs trading room ECOMMA the yuppie dealers do little right EDOT 
Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes ECOMMA Shane Longman ESINGLEQUOTEs capital should be just about exhausted by the final EONEETHREEth week EDOT 
In the opening episode we learn that Michelle ECOMMA a junior bond trader ECOMMA has indeed pulled off another million before lunch EDOT 
Trouble is ECOMMA she has lost it just as quickly EDOT 
Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world ECOMMA Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone EDOT 
Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today EDOT 
Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds ECOMMA in the belief that the UEDOTSEDOT monthly trade figures will look lousy EDOT 
Ah ECOMMA perfidious Columbia ! 
The trade figures turn out well ECOMMA and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price EDOT 
So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second EDOT 
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds EDASHLRBEDASH since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays ? EDASHRRBEDASH EDOT 
Surprisingly ECOMMA Shane Longman survives the week ECOMMA only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation EDOT 
Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm ESINGLEQUOTEs reputation ECOMMA the executive ESINGLEQUOTEs internal rivals ECOMMA led by a loutish American ECOMMA demand his resignation EDOT 
The plot is thwarted when the firm ESINGLEQUOTEs major stockholder ECOMMA kelp farming on the other side of the globe ECOMMA hurries home to support the executive EDOT 
But the investigation continues EDOT 
If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are sixEDASHfigure salaries ECOMMA you still are left puzzled ECOMMA because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously EDOT 
In fact ECOMMA few consume much of anything EDOT 
Two share a house almost devoid of furniture EDOT 
Michelle lives in a hotel room ECOMMA and although she drives a canaryEDASHcolored Porsche ECOMMA she has nESINGLEQUOTEt time to clean or repair it ESEMICOLON the beatEDASHup vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock EDOT 
And it takes Declan ECOMMA the obligatory ladies ESINGLEQUOTE man of the cast ECOMMA until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey EDOT 
Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that classEDASHconscious Britain is nESINGLEQUOTEt ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian freeEDASHenterprise regime EDOT 
After all ECOMMA this is nESINGLEQUOTEt old money ECOMMA but new money ECOMMA and in many cases ECOMMA young money EDOT 
This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max ECOMMA the trading room ESINGLEQUOTEs most flamboyant character EDOT 
Yuppily enough ECOMMA he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church ECOMMA wears designer clothes and drives an antique car EDOT 
But apparently to make him palatable ECOMMA even lovable ECOMMA to the masses ECOMMA the script inflates ponyEDASHtailed Max into an eccentric genius ECOMMA master of EONEEONE Chinese dialects EDOT 
He takes his wash to the laundromat ECOMMA where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe EDOT 
In producing and promoting EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day EDOT 
The production costs are a not inconsiderable EHASH EEIGHT million EDASHLRBEDASH EDOLAR EONEETWOEDOTEFOUR million EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of EACUTEEACUTE Dealers ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE an earlier madeEDASHforEDASHTV movie EDOT 
Another half million quid went for a volley of fullEDASHpage advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway EDOT 
These expenses create a special incentive for EACUTEEACUTE Capital City ESINGLEQUOTEs ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE producers to flog it ECOMMA or a YankEDASHoriented version of it ECOMMA in America EDOT 
Thames ESINGLEQUOTEs UEDOTSEDOT marketing agent ECOMMA Donald Taffner ECOMMA is preparing to do just that EDOT

The seeds already are in the script EDOT 
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the tradingEDASHroom crew minded a baby ECOMMA the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm EDOT

They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air EDOT 
Even network executives ECOMMA however ECOMMA admit privately that victory EDASHEDASH either in Congress or in talks with the studios EDASHEDASH is highly doubtful any time soon EDOT 
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the EACUTEEACUTE finEDASHsyn ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE provisions ECOMMA known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules EDOT 
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting CoEDOT ECOMMA backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric CoEDOT ECOMMA had tried to help fund Qintex Australia LtdEDOT ESINGLEQUOTEs nowEDASHscuttled EDOLAR EONEEDOTEFIVE billion bid for MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA Communications Co EDOT 
NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs interest may revive the deal ECOMMA which MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash EDOT 
Even if that deal is nESINGLEQUOTEt revived ECOMMA NBC hopes to find another EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE Our doors are open ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE an NBC spokesman says EDOT 
NBC may yet find a way to take a passive ECOMMA minority interest in a programEDASHmaker without violating the rules EDOT 
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS IncEDOT and ABC ESINGLEQUOTEs parent ECOMMA Capital CitiesEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHABC IncEDOT ECOMMA to look for ways of skirting the finEDASHsyn regulations EDOT 
But the networks ESINGLEQUOTE push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios EDOT 
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing finEDASHsyn restraints EDOT 
Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge EDOT 
The networks still are EACUTEEACUTE uninhibited in their authority ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE over what shows get on the air ECOMMA charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti ECOMMA the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules EDOT 
Studios are EACUTEEACUTE powerless ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE to get shows in primeEDASHtime lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales ECOMMA he contends EDOT 
And that ESINGLEQUOTEs why the rules ECOMMA for the most part ECOMMA must stay in place ECOMMA he says EDOT 
Studio executives in on the talks EDASH including officials at Paramount Communications IncEDOT ECOMMA Fries Entertainment IncEDOT ECOMMA Warner Communications IncEDOT and MCA IncEDOT EDASHEDASH declined to be interviewed EDOT 
But MrEDOT Valenti ECOMMA who represents the studios ECOMMA asserts ECOLON EACUTEEACUTE The whole production industry ECOMMA to a man ECOMMA is on the side of preserving ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE the rules EDOT 
Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE They do nESINGLEQUOTEt seem to have an incentive to negotiate ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says one network executive EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE And there ESINGLEQUOTEs no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules EDOT 
That ESINGLEQUOTEs the problem ECOMMA is nESINGLEQUOTEt it ? ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Indeed it is EDOT 
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess ECOMMA urging the studios and the networks ECOMMA which license rights to air shows made by the studios ECOMMA to work out their own compromise EDOT 
But recent developments have made the networks EDASHEDASH and NBC President Robert Wright ECOMMA in particular EDASHEDASH ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive EDOT 
The latest provocation ECOLON Sony CorpEDOT ESINGLEQUOTEs plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment IncEDOT for EDOLAR ETHREEEDOTEFOUR billion ECOMMA and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment CoEDOT for EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEZERO million EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the SonyEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHColumbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE wrote JEDOTBEDOT Holston ECOMMA an NBC vice president ECOMMA in a commentary in last week ESINGLEQUOTEs issue of Broadcasting magazine EDOT 
In his article ECOMMA MrEDOT Holston ECOMMA who was in Europe last week and unavailable ECOMMA complained that the EACUTEEACUTE archaic restraints ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE in finEDASHsyn rules have EACUTEEACUTE contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by nonEDASHUEDOTSEDOT enterprises EDOT 
ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE EDASHLRBEDASH He did nESINGLEQUOTEt mention that NBC ECOMMA in the meantime ECOMMA was hoping to assist Australia ESINGLEQUOTEs Qintex in buying 
An NBC spokesman counters that MrEDOT Holston ESINGLEQUOTEs lament was EACUTEEACUTE entirely consistent ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE with NBC plans because the UEDOTSEDOT rules would limit NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be EACUTEEACUTE light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony EDASHEDASH and everyone else except the three networks EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
The Big Three ESINGLEQUOTEs drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time IncEDOT went ahead with plans to acquire Warner EDOT 
Although Time already had a longEDASHterm contract to buy movies from Warner ECOMMA the merger will let Time ESINGLEQUOTEs largely unregulated payEDASHcable channel ECOMMA Home Box Office ECOMMA own the Warner movies aired on HBO EDASHEDASH a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by finEDASHsyn regulations EDOT 
NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs MrEDOT Wright led the way in decrying the networks ESINGLEQUOTE inability to match a TimeEDASHWarner combination EDOT 
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced EDOT 
Since NBC ESINGLEQUOTEs interest in the Qintex bid for MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA was disclosed ECOMMA MrEDOT Wright has nESINGLEQUOTEt been available for comment EDOT 
With a Qintex deal ECOMMA NBC would move into uncharted territory EDASHEDASH possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE It ESINGLEQUOTEs never really been tested ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says William Lilley III ECOMMA who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted EDOT 
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington ECOMMA consulting to media companies EDOT 
FinEDASHsyn rules do nESINGLEQUOTEt explicitly block a network from buying a passive ECOMMA small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca nESINGLEQUOTEt enjoy EDOT 
Hence ECOMMA NBC might be able to take ECOMMA say ECOMMA a EFIVE EPERCENT stake in a company such as MGMEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHUA EDOT 
If the transaction raised objections ECOMMA the studio ESINGLEQUOTEs syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does nESINGLEQUOTEt have a direct stake EDOT 
But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication EDOT 
Under current rules ECOMMA even when a network fares well with a EONEEZEROEZEROEPERCENTEDASHowned series EDASHEDASH ABC ECOMMA for example ECOMMA made a killing in broadcasting its popular crimeEBACKSLASHEFORWARDSLASHcomedy EACUTEEACUTE Moonlighting ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE EDASHEDASH it is nESINGLEQUOTEt allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations EDOT 
Instead ECOMMA ABC will have to sell off the rights for a oneEDASHtime fee EDOT 
The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim EDASHEDASH for several years at the least EDOT 
Six years ago they were tantalizingly close EDOT 
The ReaganEDASHera Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules EDOT 
Various evidence ECOMMA including a Brookings Institution study of some EEIGHTEZEROEZERO series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the EONEENINEESIXEZEROs ECOMMA showed the networks did nESINGLEQUOTEt wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged EDOT 
But just eight days before the rules were to die ECOMMA former President Ronald Reagan ECOMMA a oneEDASHtime actor ECOMMA intervened on behalf of Hollywood EDOT 
The FCC effort collapsed EDOT 
The networks and studios have bickered ever since EDOT 
Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington ECOMMA but that seems unlikely EDOT 
In Congress ECOMMA the issue falters ECOLON It ESINGLEQUOTEs about money ECOMMA not program quality ECOMMA and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue EDOT 
A spokesman for RepEDOT Edward JEDOT Markey EDASHLRBEDASH DEDASHMassEDOT EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC ECOMMA says MrEDOT Markey feels EACUTEEACUTE the world has been forever changed by the SonyEDASHColumbia deal EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE

EACUTEEACUTE It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE he said EDOT 
The bank said about CEDOLAR EFIVEETWOEFIVE million will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter ECOMMA ending OctEDOT ETHREEEONE EDOT 
MrEDOT Bowder said the CEDOLAR ETHREEEZEROEZERO million charge to earnings would amount to about CEDOLAR EONEEDOTETHREEEFOUR a share EDOT

The bank has a EFOUREFIVE EPERCENT reserve against the remaining CEDOLAR ETHREEEFOURENINE million of Mexican debt and expects to swap that for other Mexican notes supported by UEDOTSEDOT Treasury zeroEDASHcoupon bonds EDOT

Analysts ECOMMA who were expecting Alcoa to post around EDOLAR ETWOEDOTESEVENEZERO to EDOLAR ETHREE a share ECOMMA were surprised at the lackluster thirdEDASHquarter results EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE It ESINGLEQUOTEs disappointing ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said William Siedenburg ECOMMA an analyst with Smith Barney ECOMMA Harris Upham & Co EDOT 
Much of the earnings decline was led by currencyEDASHexchange rate adjustments ECOMMA which affected the bottom line by EDOLAR EONEEFIVEEDOTETHREE million ECOMMA or EONEESEVEN cents a share ECOMMA compared with EDOLAR ETHREEEDOTESIX million ECOMMA or four cents a share ECOMMA the previous year EDOT 
Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings ECOMMA the company said EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE In addition ECOMMA costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE the company said EDOT 
Excluding the higher tax rate ECOMMA which rose two percentage points to ETHREEEEIGHT EPERCENT ECOMMA and the negative exchange rate adjustment ECOMMA the company would have met analysts ESINGLEQUOTE expectations ECOMMA said REDOT Wayne Atwell ECOMMA an analyst with Goldman ECOMMA Sachs & Co EDOT

In addition ECOMMA officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs market drop turn into this morning ESINGLEQUOTEs rout EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said one government official ECOMMA insisting on anonymity EDOT 
The Fed ESINGLEQUOTEs efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning ECOMMA when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning EDOT 
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories ECOMMA according to knowledgeable sources ECOMMA and insisted he had nESINGLEQUOTEt authorized any public comment EDOT 
Nevertheless ECOMMA Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank ESINGLEQUOTEs game plan EDOT

Justin ESINGLEQUOTEs plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational EDOT 
With considerable irony ECOMMA the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on UEDOTSEDOT business EDOT 
Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by lookEDASHalike products from Japan EDOT 
Now Sony ECOMMA whose innovative ECOMMA premiumEDASHpriced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics ECOMMA is bitterly complaining about a little UEDOTSEDOT firm with a cheap lookEDASHalike produced in China EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says Lewis HEDOT Eslinger ECOMMA Sony ESINGLEQUOTEs attorney ECOMMA who previously guarded Rubik ESINGLEQUOTEs Cube EDOT 
EDASHLRBEDASH Sony itself declines to comment EDOT EDASHRRBEDASH 
If Sony wins ECOMMA MrEDOT Eslinger says ECOMMA its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas EDOT 
At worst ECOMMA he adds ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE They ESINGLEQUOTEd have to grind them all up and throw them away EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
MrEDOT Kaye denies the suit ESINGLEQUOTEs charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace EDOT

Today ECOMMA UEDOTSEDOT Judge John EEDOT Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony ESINGLEQUOTEs renewed request for a preEDASHtrial order blocking sale of the disputed products ECOMMA on which deliveries began in July EDOT 
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order EDASHEDASH a decision upheld on appeal EDASHEDASH but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments EDOT 
Though hoping to settle the case ECOMMA Justin vows to fight on ECOMMA if necessary EDOT 
But the battle is more than Justin bargained for EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE I had no idea I was getting in so deep ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says MrEDOT Kaye ECOMMA who founded Justin in EONEENINEEEIGHTETWO EDOT 
MrEDOT Kaye had sold Capetronic IncEDOT ECOMMA a Taiwan electronics maker ECOMMA and retired ECOMMA only to find he was bored EDOT 
With Justin ECOMMA he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong ECOMMA beginning with Mickey Mouse radios EDOT 
The company has grown EDASHEDASH to about EFOUREZERO employees ECOMMA from four initially ECOMMA MrEDOT Kaye says EDOT 
Justin has been profitable since EONEENINEEEIGHTESIX ECOMMA adds the official ECOMMA who shares his office with numerous teddy bears ECOMMA all samples from his line of plush toys EDOT 
Like many others ECOMMA MrEDOT Kaye took notice in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN when Sony ECOMMA in a classic example of market segmentation ECOMMA changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children EDOT 
The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models EDOT 
EDASHLRBEDASH In court papers ECOMMA Sony says it has spent more than EDOLAR ETHREE million to promote the line ECOMMA with resulting sales of over a million units EDOT EDASHRRBEDASH 
Sony found a new market niche ECOMMA but MrEDOT Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lowerEDASHpriced competitor EDOT 
His products are nESINGLEQUOTEt exact copies of Sony ESINGLEQUOTEs but strongly resemble them in size ECOMMA shape and ECOMMA especially ECOMMA color EDOT 
Sony uses mostly red and blue ECOMMA with traces of yellow EDASHEDASH and so does Justin ECOMMA on the theory that kids prefer these colors EDOT 
EDASHLRBEDASH EACUTEEACUTE To be successful ECOMMA a product can be any color whatsoever ECOMMA as long as it is fireEDASHengine red ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says Charles EEDOT Baxley ECOMMA Justin ESINGLEQUOTEs attorney EDOT EDASHRRBEDASH 
By last winter ECOMMA Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York EDASHEDASH and Sony noticed EDOT 
Indeed ECOMMA concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation EDASHEDASH such as withholding desirable Sony products EDASHEDASH against Justin ESINGLEQUOTEs customers ECOMMA MrEDOT Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April EDOT 
He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or UEDOTSEDOT Justice Department EDOT 
But Justin has nESINGLEQUOTEt pursued those charges EDASHLRBEDASH which were without merit ECOMMA according to MrEDOT Eslinger ECOMMA the Sony attorney EDASHRRBEDASH EDOT 
Recalls MrEDOT Baxley ECOLON EACUTEEACUTE Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone EDOT 
We never intended taking on Sony EDASHEDASH we do nESINGLEQUOTEt have the resources EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit EDOT 
Off and on since then ECOMMA the companies have skirmished in court EDOT 
And Justin ECOMMA in a news release ECOMMA says ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE Once competitive ECOMMA Sony now resorts to strongEDASHarm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Sony ESINGLEQUOTEs lawyer insists that the company ESINGLEQUOTEs tactics EDASHEDASH including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer EDASHEDASH are routine in such matters EDOT 
He also insists that Sony ECOMMA no less than others ECOMMA has a legal right to protect its EACUTEEACUTE trade dress ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE in this case ECOMMA mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive EDOT 
EDASHLRBEDASH Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children ESINGLEQUOTEs market EDOT EDASHRRBEDASH 
Whatever its merits ECOMMA Sony ESINGLEQUOTEs aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin EDOT 
It ESINGLEQUOTEs also costly EDOT 
MrEDOT Kaye says he has paid more than EDOLAR ESEVENEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in legal fees so far EDOT 
Of Sony ECOMMA MrEDOT Kaye says ECOLON EACUTEEACUTE They know there ESINGLEQUOTEs no way for them to lose EDOT

Lomas ECOMMA assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets ECOMMA has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing CoEDOT for several months ECOMMA apparently without success EDOT

Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bankEDASHcredit agreement ECOMMA Lomas defaulted on EDOLAR EONEEFOUREFIVE million in notes that became due SeptEDOT EONE EDOT 
It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter EONEEONE of the federal Bankruptcy Code SeptEDOT ETWOEFOUR to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its EDOLAR EONEEDOTEFOUREFIVE billion in senior debt EDOT 
Lomas said Merrill Lynch ECOMMA which owns bonds and equity in Lomas ECOMMA could nESINGLEQUOTEt continue as Lomas ESINGLEQUOTEs investment banker because it is also a creditor EDOT

First Chicago CorpEDOT posted a thirdEDASHquarter loss of EDOLAR ETWOETHREEEDOTETHREE million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans EDOT 
The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago ECOMMA with EDOLAR EFOUREEIGHT billion in assets ECOMMA said it set aside EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEZERO million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries EDOT 
The addition ECOMMA on top of two big EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN additions to foreignEDASHloan reserves ECOMMA brings the reserve to a level equaling ESEVENENINE EPERCENT of mediumEDASHterm and longEDASHterm loans outstanding to troubled nations EDOT 
First Chicago since EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN has reduced its loans to such nations to EDOLAR EONEEDOTESEVEN billion from EDOLAR ETHREE billion EDOT 
Despite this loss ECOMMA First Chicago said it does nESINGLEQUOTEt need to sell stock to raise capital EDOT 
During the quarter ECOMMA the company realized a pretax gain of EDOLAR ESIXEZEROEDOTEFOUR million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit EDOT

The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop ECOMMA which makes auto parts ECOMMA at the plant in Mulhouse after voting EFIVEEEIGHTENINE to EONEENINEETHREE to abandon the occupation EDOT 
Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises EDOT

No one can say for sure what will happen today EDOT 
And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months EDOT 
But they ESINGLEQUOTEre nearly unanimous on one point ECOLON Do nESINGLEQUOTEt sell into a panic EDOT 
Investors who sold everything after the crash of EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN lived to regret it EDOT 
Even after Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs plunge ECOMMA the Dow Jones Industrial Average was EFOUREEIGHT EPERCENT above where it landed on OctEDOT EONEENINE two years ago EDOT 
Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past EDOT 
The crash of EONEENINEETWOENINE was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the EONEENINEETHREEEZEROs began EDOT 
The EACUTEEACUTE October massacres ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE of EONEENINEESEVENEEIGHT and EONEENINEESEVENENINE were scary ECOMMA but did nESINGLEQUOTEt lead to severe or sustained downturns EDOT 
Indeed ECOMMA some pros see Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs plunge ECOMMA plus any further damage that might occur early this week ECOMMA as a chance for bargain hunting EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you ESINGLEQUOTEve got the cash ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE says Stephen BEDOT Timbers ECOMMA chief investment officer of ChicagoEDASHbased Kemper Financial Services Inc EDOT

EACUTEEACUTE It will be chaotic at first ECOMMA but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE he says EDOT 
He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now ECOMMA and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN EDOT 
MrEDOT Front of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should EACUTEEACUTE concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side ECOMMA or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE

One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy EACUTEEACUTE put ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE options ECOMMA either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index EDOT 
A put option gives its holder the right EDASHLRBEDASH but not the obligation EDASHRRBEDASH to sell a stock EDASHLRBEDASH or stock index EDASHRRBEDASH for a specified price EDASHLRBEDASH the strike price EDASHRRBEDASH until the option expires EDOT 
Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option EDOT 
The cost ECOMMA or premium ECOMMA tends to get fat in times of crisis EDOT 
Thus ECOMMA buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk EDOT 
The prices of puts generally did nESINGLEQUOTEt soar Friday EDOT 
For example ECOMMA the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & CoEDOT moved up from ETHREE EPERCENT at Thursday ESINGLEQUOTEs close to only ETHREEEDOTETHREE EPERCENT at Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs close ECOMMA even though the shares dropped more than EDOLAR EFIVEEDOTEFIVEEZERO EDOT

But investors should keep in mind ECOMMA before paying too much ECOMMA that the average annual return for stock holdings ECOMMA longEDASHterm ECOMMA is ENINE EPERCENT to EONEEZERO EPERCENT a year ESEMICOLON a return of EONEEFIVE EPERCENT is considered praiseworthy EDOT

At the same time ECOMMA six ANC colleagues ECOMMA five of whom were arrested with him in EONEENINEESIXETHREE and sentenced to life imprisonment ECOMMA were reunited with their families at various places around the country EDOT 
And as the graying men returned to their homes ECOMMA the ANC ECOMMA outlawed in South Africa since EONEENINEESIXEZERO and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government ECOMMA defiantly returned to the streets of the country ESINGLEQUOTEs black townships EDOT 
A huge ANC flag ECOMMA with black ECOMMA green and gold stripes ECOMMA was hoisted over the rickety gate at MrEDOT Sisulu ESINGLEQUOTEs modest house ECOMMA while on the street out front ECOMMA boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts ECOMMA caps and scarves EDOT 
At the small fourEDASHroom home of Elias Motsoaledi ECOMMA a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group ESINGLEQUOTEs armed wing ECOMMA Umkhonto we Sizwe ECOMMA wellEDASHwishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE I am happy to see the spirit of the people ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said MrEDOT Sisulu ECOMMA looking dapper in a new gray suit EDOT

EACUTEEACUTE I ESINGLEQUOTEm inspired by the mood of the people EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Under the laws of the land ECOMMA the ANC remains an illegal organization ECOMMA and its headquarters are still in Lusaka ECOMMA Zambia EDOT 
But the unconditional release of the seven leaders ECOMMA who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC ECOMMA is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said Cassim Saloojee ECOMMA a veteran antiEDASHapartheid activist on hand to welcome MrEDOT Sisulu EDOT

There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night ECOMMA when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in ETHREEEZERO years EDOT 
Deafening chants of EACUTEEACUTE ANC ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE and EACUTEEACUTE Umkhonto we Sizwe ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts ECOMMA including the armed struggle EDOT 
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela ECOMMA the ANC ESINGLEQUOTEs leading figure ECOMMA who was jailed with them and remains in prison EDOT

President FEDOTWEDOT de Klerk released the ANC men EDASHEDASH along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress ECOMMA a rival liberation group EDASHEDASH as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government EDOT 
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country EDOT 
As other repressive governments ECOMMA particularly Poland and the Soviet Union ECOMMA have recently discovered ECOMMA initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult ECOMMA if not impossible ECOMMA to control EDOT 
As the days go by ECOMMA the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of MrEDOT Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency EDOT 
If it does nESINGLEQUOTEt yield on these matters ECOMMA and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC ECOMMA the expectations and promise raised by yesterday ESINGLEQUOTEs releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest EDOT 
If it does ECOMMA the large number of rightEDASHwing whites ECOMMA who oppose any concessions to the black majority ECOMMA will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands EDOT 
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure EDOT 
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased antiEDASHgovernment protests and violence ESEMICOLON if it does ECOMMA Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep MrEDOT Mandela behind bars EDOT 
Pretoria has nESINGLEQUOTEt forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place ECOLON for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government EDOT 
In addition ECOMMA the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment EDOT 
In order to head off any divisions ECOMMA MrEDOT Mandela ECOMMA in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released ECOMMA instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible EDOT 
The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country ESINGLEQUOTEs many militant black youths ECOMMA the soEDASHcalled young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action EDOT

EACUTEEACUTE We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very ECOMMA very sensitive ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said Andrew Mlangeni ECOMMA another early Umkhonto leader who is now ESIXETHREE EDOT

Proposals for governmentEDASHoperated EACUTEEACUTE national service ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE like influenza ECOMMA flare up from time to time ECOMMA depress the resistance of the body politic ECOMMA run their course ECOMMA and seem to disappear ECOMMA only to mutate and afflict public life anew EDOT 
The disease metaphor comes to mind ECOMMA of course ECOMMA not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service EDOT 
Rather ECOMMA it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early EONEENINEESEVENEZEROs ECOMMA along with smallpox EDOT 
It is back with us again ECOMMA in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a EACUTEEACUTE National and Community Service Act ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall EDOT 
Why does the nationalEDASHservice virus keep coming back ? 
Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel EDOT 
If only we could get America ESINGLEQUOTEs wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach selfEDASHdiscipline again and revive the spirit of giving EDOT 
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft EDASHEDASH by ECOMMA of all things ECOMMA expanding the draft EDOT 
Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true longEDASHterm aim of many nationalEDASHservice backers ECOMMA despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion EDOT 
Choice of the volunteer military in the EONEENINEESEVENEZEROs seemed to doom national service as much as the draft EDOT 
But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago ECOMMA when it again was let loose EDOT 
This time it attempted to invade two connected problems ECOMMA the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans EDOT 
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants ECOMMA the advocates reasoned ECOMMA but require some form of service from each recipient ? 
Military service ECOMMA moreover ECOMMA could be a nationalEDASHservice option EDOT 
Thus ECOMMA undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious ECOMMA infecting patriotic conservatives ECOMMA payEDASHasEDASHyouEDASHgo moderates ECOMMA and idealistic liberals EDOT 
The Democratic Leadership Council ECOMMA a centrist group sponsoring the plan ECOMMA surely thought it might help the party to attract support ECOMMA especially among college students and their parents EDOT 
A provision allowing grants to be applied to firstEDASHhome purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling EDOT 
The DLC plan envisaged EACUTEEACUTE volunteers ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE planting trees ECOMMA emptying bedpans ECOMMA tutoring children ECOMMA and assisting librarians for EDOLAR EONEEZEROEZERO a week ECOMMA tax free ECOMMA plus medical care EDOT 
With a taxEDASHfree EDOLAR EONEEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO voucher payment at the end of each year ECOMMA the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to EDOLAR EONEESEVENECOMMAEFIVEEZEROEZERO a year EDOT 
Mind you ECOMMA most of EACUTEEACUTE the volunteers ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE would be unskilled EONEESEVEN EDASH to EONEEEIGHTEDASHyearEDASHolds ECOMMA some not even high school graduates ECOMMA and many saving money by living at home EDOT 
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families EDOT 
As it happened ECOMMA political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system ECOMMA so the nationalEDASHservice devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of EACUTEEACUTE give in order to get EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Opposition to national service from the Pentagon ECOMMA which wants to protect its own recruitment process ECOMMA also led to the militaryEDASHservice option being dropped EDOT 
Clearly ECOMMA a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up EDOT 
What better place to turn than SenEDOT Edward Kennedy ESINGLEQUOTEs Labor Committee ECOMMA that great stove of government expansionism ECOMMA where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ? 
In this case ECOMMA the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle ECOLON a demonstration project for educational aid EDASHLRBEDASH particularly satisfying to the DLC and SenEDOT Sam Nunn EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA a similar demonstration program for youth conservation EDASHLRBEDASH a la SenEDOT Chris Dodd EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects EDASHLRBEDASH a Kennedy specialty EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA a community service workEDASHstudy program for students EDASHLRBEDASH pleasing to the palate of SenEDOT Dale Bumpers ECOMMA among others EDASHRRBEDASH ECOMMA plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer ECOMMA Foster Grandparent ECOMMA and Senior Companion programs EDOT 
Before the menu is printed ECOMMA the House may add more ingredients ECOMMA also changing the initial price ECOMMA now posted at some EDOLAR ETHREEETHREEEZERO million EDOT 
It is widely known that EACUTEEACUTE too many cooks spoil the broth ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks ECOMMA especially if they are senators EDOT 
The EACUTEEACUTE omnibus ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop ECOMMA but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard EDOT 
The aroma of patronage is in the air EDOT 
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? 
On the contrary ECOMMA it is as robust as ever EDOT 
According to the Gallup Poll ECOMMA American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service ECOMMA while financial contributions to charity in the EONEENINEEEIGHTEZEROs have risen ETHREEEZERO EPERCENT EDASHLRBEDASH adjusted for inflation EDASHRRBEDASH EDOT 
Even if government does see various EACUTEEACUTE unmet needs ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE national service is not the way to meet them EDOT 
If we want to support students ECOMMA we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called EACUTEEACUTE scholarship ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE rather than on the government ESINGLEQUOTEs idea of EACUTEEACUTE service EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students EDOT 
What we do not need to do is start a war ECOMMA and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill EDOT 
To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals ECOMMA for example ECOMMA we should raise pay ECOMMA pursue laborEDASHsaving technology ECOMMA or allow more legal immigration ECOMMA rather than overpay high school graduates as shortEDASHterm workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs EDOT 
Will national service ECOMMA in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ? 
Not necessarily EDOT 
Polls show wide ECOMMA generalized support for some vague concept of service ECOMMA but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing EDOT 
Nonetheless ECOMMA Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting EACUTEEACUTE associations ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE EACUTEEACUTE societies ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE and EACUTEEACUTE councils ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE some of which may hope to receive the paid EACUTEEACUTE volunteers EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
So far ECOMMA the president seems illEDASHdisposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own freeEDASHstanding proposal to endow a EACUTEEACUTE Points of Light ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE foundation with EDOLAR ETWOEFIVE million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism EDOT 
However ECOMMA even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president ESINGLEQUOTEs initiative or to involve the independent foundation in EACUTEEACUTE brokering ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE federal funds for volunteer projects EDOT 
There ESINGLEQUOTEs no need for such concessions EDOT 
The omnibus can be defeated ECOMMA the virus controlled ECOMMA and real service protected EDOT 
National service ECOMMA the utopian idea ECOMMA still wo nESINGLEQUOTEt go away then ECOMMA of course ECOMMA but the millions of kneeEDASHsocked youth performing works of EACUTEEACUTE civic content ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors EDOT

The lower net included a charge of EDOLAR ETHREEEFIVE million ECOMMA equal to EONEETWO cents a share on an afterEDASHtax basis ECOMMA for the cost of abandoning a computerEDASHsystems joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany EDOT 
Earning also fell from the yearEDASHago period because of slowing microchip demand EDOT

Intel ESINGLEQUOTEs stock rose in early overEDASHtheEDASHcounter trading Friday ECOMMA as investors appeared relieved that the company ESINGLEQUOTEs income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter ESINGLEQUOTEs earnings of EDOLAR ENINEENINEEDOTETHREE million ECOMMA or EFIVEETHREE cents a share ECOMMA and that sales actually exceeded the EDOLAR ESEVENEFOURESEVENEDOTETHREE million for the second period EDOT 
But Intel later succumbed to the stock market ESINGLEQUOTEs plunge ECOMMA closing at EDOLAR ETHREEEONEEDOTESEVENEFIVE ECOMMA down EDOLAR ETWOEDOTEONEETWOEFIVE EDOT 
In August ECOMMA Intel warned that thirdEDASHquarter earnings might be EACUTEEACUTE flat to down ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE from the previous period ESINGLEQUOTEs because of slowing sales growth of its EEIGHTEZEROETHREEEEIGHTESIX microprocessor ECOMMA startEDASHup costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company ESINGLEQUOTEs new EEIGHTEZEROEFOUREEIGHTESIX chip in the current quarter EDOT

Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs EONEENINEEZEROEDASHpoint plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN October crash ECOMMA and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly EDOT 
Still ECOMMA the lesson is about the same ECOLON On Friday the EONEETHREEth ECOMMA the market was spooked by Washington EDOT 
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover ECOMMA and it ESINGLEQUOTEs certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt EDOT 
Still ECOMMA the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all UEDOTSEDOT business EDOT 
This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn ECOLON the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut EDOT 
The real value of all shares ECOMMA after all ECOMMA is directly impacted by the tax on any profits EDASHLRBEDASH all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not EACUTEEACUTE ordinary income ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE EDASHRRBEDASH EDOT 
And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month EDOT 
An hour before Friday ESINGLEQUOTEs plunge ECOMMA that provision was stripped from the tax bill ECOMMA leaving it with EDOLAR EFIVEEDOTEFOUR billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut EDOT 
There is a great deal to be said ECOMMA to be sure ECOMMA for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill EDOT 
It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues oneEDASHbyEDASHone on their individual merits without trickery EDOT 
For one thing ECOMMA no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an upEDASHorEDASHdown vote EDOT 
Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens ECOMMA promises of a cleaner bill are suspect EDOT 
Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco EDOT 
To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge ECOMMA they are another instance of Washington ESINGLEQUOTEs sticky fingers EDOT 
As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course ECOMMA at some point the market will start to reject them EDOT 
But the airlines are scarcely a clear case ECOMMA given antiEDASHtakeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner ECOMMA who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes EDOT 
Worse ECOMMA Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon EDOT 
James Oberstar ECOMMA the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee ESINGLEQUOTEs aviation subcommittee ECOMMA has put an antiEDASHairline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids EDOT 
It would give MrEDOT Skinner up to EFIVEEZERO days to EACUTEEACUTE review ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE any bid for EONEEFIVE EPERCENT or more of the voting stock of any UEDOTSEDOT carrier with revenues of EDOLAR EONE billion or more EDOT 
So the UAL deal has problems ECOMMA and the market loses EONEENINEEZERO points EDOT 
Congratulations ECOMMA MrEDOT Secretary and MrEDOT Congressman EDOT 
In the EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN crash ECOMMA remember ECOMMA the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance EDOT 
Even more important ECOMMA in our view ECOMMA was the Treasury ESINGLEQUOTEs threat to thrash the dollar EDOT 
The Treasury is doing the same thing today ESEMICOLON thankfully ECOMMA the dollar is not under EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVENEDASHstyle pressure EDOT 
Also ECOMMA traders are in better shape today than in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN to survive selling binges EDOT 
They are better capitalized EDOT

The Fed promises any needed liquidity EDOT 
The Big Board ESINGLEQUOTEs liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ESEMICOLON it will be interesting to learn if EACUTEEACUTE circuit breakers ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE prove to be a good idea EDOT 
In any event ECOMMA some traders see stocks as underpriced today ECOMMA unlike EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN EDOT 
There is nothing wrong with the market that ca nESINGLEQUOTEt be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington EDOT 
But on the bearish side ECOMMA that may be too much to expect EDOT 
A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca nESINGLEQUOTEt hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product ESINGLEQUOTEs flaws EDOT 
The ruling stems from a EONEENINEEEIGHTEFOUR suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer IncEDOT ECOMMA claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer ECOMMA introduced in EONEENINEEEIGHTETHREE EDOT 
Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the EACUTEEACUTE press defense ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling EDOT 
According to the suit ECOMMA Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year EDOT 
The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare ECOMMA the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa EDOT 
The suit claimed Apple ESINGLEQUOTEs stock climbed to a high of EDOLAR ESIXETHREEEDOTEFIVEEZERO a share on the basis of the company ESINGLEQUOTEs optimistic forecasts EDOT 
But when the company revealed Lisa ESINGLEQUOTEs poor sales late in EONEENINEEEIGHTETHREE ECOMMA the stock plummeted to a low of EDOLAR EONEESEVENEDOTETHREEESEVEN a share ECOMMA according to the suit EDOT 
The shareholders claimed more than EDOLAR EONEEFIVEEZERO million in losses EDOT 
In EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company ESINGLEQUOTEs statements by alerting consumers to Lisa ESINGLEQUOTEs problems EDOT 
Late last month ECOMMA the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed EDOT 
However ECOMMA it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to Lisa ESINGLEQUOTEs disk drive ECOMMA known as Twiggy EDOT 
The court ruled that the news media did nESINGLEQUOTEt reveal Twiggy ESINGLEQUOTEs problems at the time EDOT 
Lawyers are worried about the ruling ESINGLEQUOTEs implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the Apple case EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company ESINGLEQUOTEs statements ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE said Patrick Grannon ECOMMA a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & Chimicles ECOMMA which was nESINGLEQUOTEt involved in the case EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE The court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
Shareholders ESINGLEQUOTE attorneys at the New York firm of Milberg ECOMMA Weiss ECOMMA Bershad ECOMMA Specthrie & Lerach last week petitioned for a rehearing of the case EDOT

NFL ORDERED to pay EDOLAR EFIVEEDOTEFIVE million in legal fees to defunct 
The National Football League is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the UEDOTSEDOT Football League ESINGLEQUOTEs largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the NFL EDOT

But the jury awarded the USFL only EDOLAR EONE in damages ECOMMA trebled because of the antitrust claims EDOT 
Last week ECOMMA the UEDOTSEDOT Court of Appeals in New York upheld a EDOLAR EFIVEEDOTEFIVE million award of attorneys fees to the defunct league EDOT

Myerson & Kuhn will get about EDOLAR ETWOESIXEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO for the costs of pressing the application EDOT 
The federal appeals court held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did nESINGLEQUOTEt exclude the USFL from being reimbursed EDOT 
Antitrust laws provide that injured parties may be reimbursed for lawyers ESINGLEQUOTE fees EDOT 
But Shepard Goldfein ECOMMA an attorney for the NFL ECOMMA says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the UEDOTSEDOT Supreme Court EDOT 
MrEDOT Goldfein ECOMMA of Skadden ECOMMA Arps ECOMMA Slate ECOMMA Meagher & Flom in New York ECOMMA says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the USFL lost its major claims ECOMMA including its contention that the NFL restrained trade through television contracts EDOT

HOUSTONEDASHCALGARY ALLIANCE ECOLON

Of all the oneEDASHtime expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm ECOMMA few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease EDOT 
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment ECOMMA however ECOMMA the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms EDOT 
It must also evaluate the realEDASHestate market in the chosen location from a new perspective EDOT 
Specifically ECOMMA it must understand how realEDASHestate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities EDOT 
When a regional economy catches cold ECOMMA the local realEDASHestate market gets pneumonia EDOT 
In other words ECOMMA realEDASHestate market indicators ECOMMA such as building permits and leasing activity ECOMMA plummet much further than a local economy in recession EDOT
