Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate EDOLAR EONE million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five UEDOTSEDOT senators who interceded with thriftEDASHindustry regulators for him EDOT 
MrEDOT Keating is currently the subject of a EDOLAR EONEEDOTEONE billion federal antiEDASHracketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled ECOMMA Lincoln Savings & Loan Association ECOMMA and driving it into insolvency EDOT

MrEDOT Wertheimer based this on a statement by MrEDOT Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April ECOLON EACUTEEACUTE One question EDOTEDOTEDOT had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause EDOT 
I want to say in the most forceful way I can ECOLON I certainly hope so EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
In a highly unusual meeting in SenEDOT DeConcini ESINGLEQUOTEs office in April EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln EDOT 
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting ECOMMA the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ESINGLEQUOTE federally insured money and was EACUTEEACUTE a ticking time bomb EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
MrEDOT Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous EDOT 
The notes show that SenEDOT DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ESINGLEQUOTEs regulations EACUTEEACUTE grossly unfair ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE and that SenEDOT Glenn insisted that MrEDOT Keating ESINGLEQUOTEs thrift was EACUTEEACUTE viable and profitable EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
For the next two years ECOMMA the Bank Board ECOMMA which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts ECOMMA failed to act EDASHEDASH even after federal auditors warned in May EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN that MrEDOT Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent EDOT 
Lincoln ESINGLEQUOTEs parent company ECOMMA American Continental CorpEDOT ECOMMA entered bankruptcyEDASHlaw proceedings this April EONEETHREE ECOMMA and regulators seized the thrift the next day EDOT

Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years ECOMMA mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers EDOT 
In the midst of his EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT reEDASHelection campaign ECOMMA SenEDOT Riegle ECOMMA chairman of the Senate Banking Committee ECOMMA returned EDOLAR ESEVENESIXECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that MrEDOT Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators EDOT 
SenEDOT DeConcini ECOMMA after months of fending off intense press criticism ECOMMA returned EDOLAR EFOUREEIGHTECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO only last month ECOMMA shortly after the government formally accused MrEDOT Keating of defrauding Lincoln EDOT 
In addition ECOMMA SenEDOT McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid EDOLAR EONEETHREEECOMMAEFOURETHREEETHREE to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to MrEDOT Keating ESINGLEQUOTEs vacation home at Cat Cay ECOMMA the Bahamas ECOMMA from EONEENINEEEIGHTEFOUR through EONEENINEEEIGHTESIX EDOT 
SenEDOT McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter EACUTEEACUTE fell between the cracks EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
MrEDOT Keating ECOMMA his family members and associates also donated EDOLAR EONEEONEETWOECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO to SenEDOT McCain ESINGLEQUOTEs congressional campaigns over the years ECOMMA according to press accounts EDOT 
But SenEDOT McCain says MrEDOT Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN ECOMMA because the senator refused to press the thrift executive ESINGLEQUOTEs case as vigorously as MrEDOT Keating wanted EDOT 
EACUTEEACUTE He became very angry at that ECOMMA left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp ECOMMA ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE SenEDOT McCain recalls EDOT 
In July ECOMMA California newspapers disclosed that MrEDOT Keating gave EDOLAR EEIGHTEFIVEEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate funds to three taxEDASHexempt voter registration organizations in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN and EONEENINEEEIGHTEEIGHT at the behest of SenEDOT Cranston ECOMMA who conceded that soliciting the money was EACUTEEACUTE a pretty stupid thing to do politically EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
In addition ECOMMA SenEDOT Cranston received EDOLAR EFOURESEVENECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in campaign donations through MrEDOT Keating ECOMMA and the California Democratic party received EDOLAR EEIGHTEFIVEECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate donations for a EONEENINEEEIGHTESIX getEDASHoutEDASHtheEDASHvote drive that benefited the senator ESINGLEQUOTEs reEDASHelection campaign that year EDOT 
Also in July ECOMMA Ohio newspapers disclosed EDOLAR ETWOEZEROEZEROECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in corporate donations by MrEDOT Keating to the National Council on Public Policy ECOMMA a political committee controlled by SenEDOT Glenn EDOT 
That was in addition to EDOLAR ETHREEEFOURECOMMAEZEROEZEROEZERO in direct campaign donations arranged by MrEDOT Keating to the Ohio senator EDOT 
MrEDOT Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation ECOMMA as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright EDOT 
Wilson Abney ECOMMA staff director of the ethics panel ECOMMA would nESINGLEQUOTEt comment EDOT 
SenEDOT Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry ECOMMA but that his conduct had been EACUTEEACUTE entirely proper EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
SenEDOT McCain said he had been EACUTEEACUTE deeply concerned ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper ECOMMA but decided it was EACUTEEACUTE entirely appropriate ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent EDOT 
SenEDOT Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and EACUTEEACUTE I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
SenEDOT DeConcini said ECOMMA EACUTEEACUTE When all is said and done ECOMMA I expect to be fully exonerated EDOT ESINGLEQUOTEESINGLEQUOTE 
SenEDOT Cranston ECOMMA who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of MrEDOT Keating ECOMMA portrayed his role in EONEENINEEEIGHTESEVEN as prodding regulators to act EDOT
